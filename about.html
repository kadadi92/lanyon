<h2>About Cookie usage on Novellatranslation.com</h2>
<p>We are currently using Google Analytics while the site is still under construction. We will most likely remove it once our website is finalized, but we will make it very clear if we decide to continue using Analytics. Google Analytics uses a cookie that can track your activity across only our website. This cookie is a session cookie, which means as soon as you close your browser, this cookie will be deleted. All of this data is anonymized and aggregated, the information is not passed on to third parties.</p>

<p>We are also using a persistent cookie to save which theme (dark or light) you have set. That cookie has an expiration time of one year. This theme cookie is only set, if you are actually changing the default theme and is deleted once you change the theme back to black.</p>

<p>All of our cookies are set exclusively with JavaScript. To stop cookies from being set, you can disable JavaScript or cookies in your browser settings. Hereâ€™s an example.</p>
