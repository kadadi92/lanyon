<p>"I see flowers."<br />
"She's looking at flowers."<br />
Two stalkers looking at a pretty girl who was looking at flowers.<br />
No, the prince was the one real stalker, I was just his guard.<br />
<br /><!--more-->
"Oh, I feel uncomfortable."<br />
"It shows."<br />
"Is it because of that harassment we witnessed to before?"<br />
"No, I am probably hungry."<br />
The prince turned his eyes away from Iris and he looked at me.<br />
"Are you serious?"<br />
He was trying to tell me something.<br />
I didn't know what to do.<br />
<br />
"Anyhow, it looks like Iris likes the flowers."<br />
"There is something regal in you."<br />
"Is there?"<br />
I blushed.<br />
A lot.<br />
<br />
Apparently I was not accustomed to being praised by a handsome man.<br />
I was always busy doing something, so I never had anybody around me.<br />
<br />
I could double down on it, and hope for a greater reward.<br />
But for the moment, keeping a moderate distance was better. No, I didn't want to come closer, if possible.<br />
<br />
"You are thinking about dirty stuff right now."<br />
"No, absolutely not."<br />
He was trying to make his personality manifest. What a situation!<br />
<br />
"Iris seems to be moving."<br />
"Come, let's go follow her."<br />
<br />
<br />
Iris' next destination was her usual farm.<br />
Her favorite vegetables were growing fast and good.<br />
<br />
When she got there she always watered the field a lot.<br />
Any trace of sadness disappeared from her face, and she smiled.<br />
<br />
"What is she growing?"<br />
"Don't you see it?"<br />
"Don't answer to a question with more questions. Just say what you are asked."<br />
"It's vegetables."<br />
"Vegetables..."<br />
It made no sense for the prince to be confused.<br />
The prince, who should have been knowledgeable, had no idea what vegetables were.<br />
<br />
"Aren't they too big?"<br />
"Maybe it is the prince who has become smaller."<br />
he prince seemed very interested in that big vegetable.<br />
The nation is a prince's pride. He ought to strive ad create a rich country. And he should have returned with his feet back on the ground.<br />
<br />
"Who is helping her in the fields?"<br />
"It's a man named Toto. He just left the greenhouse."<br />
A guy coming out of the greenhouse was chatting with Iris.<br />
It had to be Toto.<br />
All seemed fine.<br />
<br />
<a name="result_box2"></a>"Does he feel something for Iris?"<br />
"Please, listen to them yourself."<br />
I knew that Toto was not in love with Iris, but the prince would not take me at my word.<br />
He was listening to them talk.<br />
<br />
"I will get rid of him."<br />
"Stop!"<br />
It was the second time that day I had to prevent a fight.<br />
Oh, come on! He was already leaning towards violence!<br />
<br />
"No, they're just friends!"<br />
"Well, that's fine, then."<br />
He looked like a tyrant. In just one moment he could snap like that!<br />
<br />
While I was trying to hold the prince back, and those two were chatting happily, I noticed that Toto's complexion changed.<br />
A noise came from the doghouse we had made the day before.<br />
<br />
Oh, Goru seemed to have woken up.<br />
<br />
Goru jumped out of the doghouse and ran towards Iris at full speed.<br />
Along the way, he changed his target into Toto, and began chasing him with a threatening look.<br />
I think he was just jesting.<br />
<br />
I absolutely loved that dog.<br />
"Bad, bad boy, Alfredo, stop it."<br />
After Iris spoke, the dog immediately calmed down.<br />
<br />
Toto was about to die.<br />
Poor guy.<br />
<br />
"Hey, since when do you have that dog?"<br />
"A couple of days."<br />
"Did you call him Alfredo?"<br />
"No, he's Goru."<br />
"Eh! But Iris just called him Alfredo!"<br />
<a name="result_box3"></a>"It's Goru."<br />
"... Goru?"<br />
It was the second anniversary of the birth of the Goroist faction.<br />
It was a bit of a stretch, I know.<br />
<br />
While I was dissuading the prince, the aforementioned Goru now looked towards us.<br />
He clearly couldn't see us behind the bushed, but it was like he was aware of us.<br />
"Did he smell us?"<br />
Was it really the case?<br />
Okay, was it time for the two stalkers to come out of the shadows?<br />
<br />
However, Goru soon lost interest and got distracted by something else.<br />
All the attention gathering on our hideout faded away.<br />
<br />
"Well, we're safe apparently."<br />
"I won't do this again. I am literally sweating right now."<br />
"I still don't understand."<br />
Was Iris really depressed?<br />
Well, she looked absolutely fine.<br />
<br />
When Iris left the field, she did not return to the dorm.<br />
The day was already dawning.<br />
<br />
Even though it was dinner time, she left the school garden on her own.<br />
The sunset was gradually turning to red.<br />
<br />
The prince blushed while looking at the horizon.<br />
"Yeah, not bad."<br />
<br />
Iris sat down in the field and pulled out some cheap paper from her pocket.<br />
Cheap making, the texture was also thin and rough.<br />
<br />
Iris was staring at it.<br />
She was not just staring. Apparently there was something written on it. She read very carefully.<br />
Indeed, there lied our answer.</p>

<p><br />
<a name="result_box4"></a>"Koibuma?! He gave it to her!?"<br />
"No, probably somebody in her family gave it to her."<br />
"Really?"<br />
"Yeah, the nobles do not use such cheap paper."<br />
<br />
<br />
Iris folded back the piece of paper.<br />
Perhaps she was thinking about her family, that she had not seen for more than six months.<br />
<br />
It looked like the prince could be right.<br />
Iris was depressed after all. She was worried because of her family.<br />
<br />
"Now I see."<br />
"Does Iris want to see her family? But it's only three years, why does she worry so much?"<br />
"Well, things are different for us, it's hard for you to walk in our shoes."<br />
I knew that feeling.<br />
Make the prince understand would be difficult.<br />
<br />
"Then you can help me understand."<br />
"The winter holidays are coming, and Iris does not plan to return home. She thinks that if she studies more, she will have better chances of finding a good job."</p>

<p>"There will be more good opportunities in the future."<br />
The prince showed a huge grin as soon as he sad that. What was on his mind?<br />
<br />
"Oh, is it the Autumn Sports Festival?"<br />
"Yes, the only opportunity for parents to visit the school will come soon."<br />
"So Iris might have been thinking about her family all along, and we were not aware of it."<br />
"We were not until now. I will fix everything."<br />
I realized the prince was going to use his position to do something.<br />
<br />
"Iris' family are commoners, they they cannot participate."<br />
"If they will be able to see their daughter, I'm sure they will be happy about it."<br />
The prince looked really motivated.<br />
<br />
"Please do not tell this to anybody, especially the other people living with her. Think about the whole picture."<br />
"How many gold coins would that be?"<br />
We were talking about gold! Really!<br />
Things couldn't go any better.</p>

<p>“20 would be enough, is it? Please keep it confidential”<br/>
I got on the prince's proposal in the spirit of having money if I had it.<br/>
it’s not a bad thing to wish that girl want to see her family</p>

<p>If you do not do too much, you should move in a good direction! I believed and took the devil's invitation.</p>
<p>Thus the rite of the iris' family summoning was done.</p>
