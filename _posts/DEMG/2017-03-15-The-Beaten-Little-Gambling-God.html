<p>Tang Meng didn't hold back, he directly placed his seat in front of Ling Yun and spoke so loud.

<p>Ling Yun had an impression towards a long-haired arrogant boy just now.

<p>He was holding onto a sandbag to help him recover from falling on the ground, he turned his head back and watched the scenery of Tang Meng trampled that boy.

<p>Ling Yun lifted his arm, palm faced up, his forefinger was picking on him three times.

<p>"Get up!" His voice was calming yet cold.

<p>This was a seat meant for his little sister, although that boy offered help but Ling Yun didn't even want to accept it.

<p><p>Tang Meng stunned for a while, saw Ling Yun was like that.

<p>If widely see, Xie Jun Yan didn't even dare to do like that, but a fatty loser like that could even calmly commanded him to get up.

<p>"Are you nuts? Do you know who I am, and you dare tell me to get up?"

<p>Tang Meng was there to bring money, the amount of the money was a really "scary" ten thousand Yuan, though he was polite toward Ning Ling Yu, but that didn't mean he could act the same towards Ling Yu.

<p>He still felt a slight admire to the fatty. 

<p>"I don't care who you are, I told you to get up so just get up!" Ling Yun frowned a little, he doubt that boy was so furious.
　
<p>Tang Meng was dumbfounded of the fatty in front of him could even be bully by others? Judging by the way he talks and acts could even bring peace to the bad people? 

<p>He came here for a gambling debt, but to be treated like this by Ling Yun, he felt angry inside him.

<p>But he casted a glance to the far away Ning Ling Yu, Ning Ling Yu glared back to him, his anger vanished, Ning Ling Yu was like letting him go for this time.

<p>Then he shamelessly lying on a chair, his hair elegantly swung and said: "I'm not getting up, so what?"

<p>He just wanted to see what will Ling Yun do.

<p>Ling Yun laughed, his eyebrow slightly lifted up, he stood up and left his seat.

<p>He really wanted to throw that jerk out.

<p>"Damn, it isn't real right?" Ling Yun did something that made Tang Meng shocked, both his arms were on his chest meant that he was like protect himself.
</p>
<p>"Brother......Ah, Tang Meng, why are you here?"
　　</p>
Ning Ling Yu just finished ordering menu and she heard noises, she ran up and felt angry the moment she saw Tang Meng</p>.

<p>Because Ning Ling Yu never act kind to Tang Meng.

<p>Tang Meng rarely saw Ning Ling Yu dressed like that, her long hair looked as smooth and wet as waterfall, with a t-shirt white as snow, with her slim legs covered in blue jeans, she looked stunning in his eyes.

<p>He almost drooled, he had a face like a pig.

<p>Ling Yun's face had gone dark, he saw Tang Meng acted like that, he was thinking about Tang Meng was there for his little sister.

<p>"Hehe, Ling Yu, uhm, I came here for you......" Tang Meng flattered when he talked to Ning Ling Yu.

<p>"I have nothing to say, go away, I want to eat with my brother!" Ning Ling Yu hated Tang Meng for taking her brother made a gambling party.

<p>Of course, she worried that she took her living money to put a stake on was founded by Ling Yun, so she had to drive Tang Meng away.</p>

<p>But Tang Meng still wanted to talk to her.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear, my little sister said go away, I'll do anything if you're trying to stand there too long." Ling Yun coldly said.</p>

<p>Tang Meng was speechless for a moment, how come these brother and sister are so rude? I'm a son of the rich okay?
In the afternoon after school, the students were all dashing into the canteen, the canteen spreaded out a loud crackling noise.
　　
<p>Tang Meng thought that he would never treat any other beauty, hurry up and do his stuffs and don't let the school finds out about he gave one thousand Yen to Ning Ling Yu.

<p>About Ling Yun, hm, he would wait until Ning Ling Yu isn't there.

<p>"Ling Yu, I came here to give you some money, did you forget......"

<p>Tang Meng just said it and Ning Ling Yu's face had changed, damn, why did he talk about it in front of her brother?

<p>"I don't want to, go away!" Ning Ling Yu shoo him away while he was taking out the money from his pocket.

<p>"Money?! Wait!" Ling Yun was in need of money, damn, Ling Yu was so pure, why did she shoo out somebody who came here to give money?

<p>He let Tang Meng take a seat, he won't let Tang Meng go away if he came for giving them money!

<p>"Please sit down, and have a talk, Ling Yu, quick, tell the buddy to bring a pot of tea! Hurry up!" Ling Yun sat down too, this time, he was like another person, he showed his smile towards Tang Meng.

<p>"crack......"

<p>"ahh......"

<p>Ning Ling Yu and Tang Meng were fooled.

<p>Tang Meng has gone nuts! He was treated coldly before, but now? How did he change his facial expression so fast!

<p>The puzzled Ning Ling Yu, her brother said pride is number one, why now, he heard Tang Meng came to give money and he just turned into another person?

<p>What was that for, tell the buddy to bring a pot of tea.

<p>Ling Yun glared to Ning Ling Yu, "Why are you still standing in there, hurry the tea pot."

<p>Ning Ling Yu couldn't even understand, her brother changed a lot today, she wouldn't want him to get angry instead she glared to Tang Meng and go away.

<p>Ling Yun smiled while looking to Tang Meng, carefully stared into him.

<p>Tang Meng felt that fatty was staring him like a prey.

<p>"How much is it?" This was what Ling Yun worried the most, if he's going to give him lot of money, he will treat him with love and let Tang Meng give the money to him.

<p>If it is just ten or twenty yuan, he would throw him away.

<p>"One thousand and five hundred yuan." Ling Yun shivered so much after heard those amount.

<p>Tang Meng couldn't understand Ling Yun no more.

<p>The moment a person can't read other people's minds, usually they feel unsure about themselves, and feel timid.

<p>Ling Yun was staggered, he almost fell down under the table.

<p>"Hehe, my bad, my bad!" Ling Yun took his seat, he straightened his body.

<p>He took out his hand in front of Tang Meng. That was so straight forwarded, give him the money.

<p>Such amount of money, he needed it of course. Once the money fall down into Ling Yun, nobody can even take away from him.

<p>"You didn't even want to know how I got such amount?" Tang Meng was curious, he was so unlucky today.

<p>"Maybe some other time, we talk about it, give me the money first." Ling Yun lifted his hands.

<p>"I can't give the money to you, these are for Ning Ling Yu......" Tang Meng saw a student on the second floor, he tried his best not to be seen, but it still happened.

<p>He hated himself not to have a long hair to cover up his face. His nickname "little gambling god", will be poluted!

<p>"It's the same, Ling Yu, what are you doing right there, come and take the money......" Ling Yun was burning with anxiety, he even yelled at her.

<p>Ning Ling Yu knew that his brother already knew everything, she couldn't hold the shameless face, slowly approached them.

<p>Ling Yun stood up, he let Ning Ling Yu sat on the seat near the wall, and said something to his sister: "Ling Yu, see......your friend here came to give money, and why did you hide?"

<p>Ning Ling Yu's face had gone red like an apple, she looked down without saying anything.

<p>Tang Meng took one thousand out, and then another five hundred, he stacked it together and placed in front of Ning Ling Yu, said: "Ling Yu, this is your winning money and the regular monthly, one thousand and five hundred yuan of total, you can count it first."

<p>Tang Meng could afford to lose!

<p>But she just took the five hundred yuan, she didn't even take a look at the one thousand on the table.

<p>"I was just angry before, I didn't mean to take your winning money, I can't have these, you can take it back." Ning Ling Yu said.

<p>Tang Meng felt his heart crushed by what she said!

<p>He gave out one thousand yuan just like, to be honest Tang Meng felt really sad to give his money away!

<p>But he's willing to lose the gambling, if he needed to pay, he'll pay. If he lose the gambling, he should pay the money to the winner, because if he didn't, it wasn't his style!

<p>Such amount of money was placed on the table, in front of the most beautiful beauty, she didn't even stare at it!

<p>Right at this moment, Tang Meng had his heart filled with Ning Ling Yu, she had a really really unlimited high position inside his heart.

<p>"shhh" for a while, a big fat hand of Ling Yun's snatched the money on the table, he quickly put inside his pocket.

<p>Those rapid hands of Ling Yun's, why his little sister was so dumb, why didn't she take the money? Tang Meng came here to give it, we didn't even have to rob him. Don't want the money that was delivered to our house? That is not Ling Yun's style! That's not!

<p>The moment two people were in puzzled, only Ling Yun felt so much joy and satisfaction, he had a strong sense of righteousness and said: "Alright, this friend, the money you lose to my sister, I officially take it under her name, look at you so kindheartedly, let me treat you for today.

<p>"cracks......" Tang Meng had no expression in a sudden!

<p>What was that, because you acted kindheartedly and you were going to treat us a meal?

<p>I just brought the money okay?

<p>There are so many shameless person, but to be this shameless...... Tang Meng thought really hard and he never met anybody more shameless than Ling Yun.

<p>He really hates the fatty in front of him.

<p>If it wasn't for Ning Ling Yu...... Hm! Oh right!

<p>He got the money about one thousand yen, was it still not enough to treat Ning Ling Yu a meal? This was the rarest chance he could ever get!
