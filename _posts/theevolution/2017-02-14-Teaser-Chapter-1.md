<h1> Chapter 1 - To a New World </h1>
<p>This is my name. I am a second grade student going to a special high school.
<p>Even if it is special, it is not a place where people have cartoon-like abilities, or frequented by aliens.
<p>It is rather a so-called idol training school...
<!--more-->
<p>Famous school girl and boy idols go to the same school where I go.
<p>But do I look anything like them? If you asked that, the answer would be “no”. Not even close.
<p>Luckily, at least I'm not bald. But I'm pretty uggly, and I smell terribly.
<p>Once I smelled so much, that I didn't dare to sit at my desk. Not even when the other students, and the teacher, invited me to.
<p>I am such a celebrity that everyone knows me at school... in a bad way.
<p>Moreover, I recently started to gain weight. I weighted 70kg when I arrived, but now I'm around 100kg. I think well of myself, but I can never live up to it.
<p>I began getting fat after my parents passed away in an accident, and my happy days ended. It is the result of lacking parental guidance. Some say that a true person owns itself. Should I ask mom and dad for forgiveness?
<p>As far as the looks are concerned, I can say that I have already given up, but it is my name that I really cannot stand.
<p>No, Seiichi is cool as of sounds and letters, but my appearance isn't, so there is no point in changing my name. To the extent that you want to become a pedestal for the whole world to watch. I'm sorry.
<p>Why am I like this? Well, if you go to a school like mine, it's obvious you get burned. It may not be an exaggeration to say that it is the center of the world.
<p>So, why am I in this school? We are getting to it.
<p>It is because the school is very close to my house, and because it is a school where you can enter even if your scores are not that good. Even ordinary people like me can go to this school as if it was normal.
<p>Isn't it useless? Well, if you want to have a laugh it's funny! I am reflecting and regretting at the same time!
<p>But really, I will admit that I hate myself, for convenience, but I don't care about the bullies. I would have been bullied even if I entered another high school.
<p>There is a really profound reason why he has been doing such a long self-explanation.
<p>This monologue is also necessary to keep his sanity.
<p>So why are you doing this?</p>
<p>It dates back to some time ago...

◆◇◆

<p>"Hey, pigeye! Go buy some bread!"
<p>"Of course, put that money to good use!"
<p>Gahahahaha Ha!
<p>Along with these laughter, I was called names by several of the boys in the back of the gym, students during the lunch break, and I was there listening.
<p>Well, well, there are truly amazing people at this school... There are also nation idols and somewhat famous persons. While me, I am nothing compared to them.
<p>However, I can not deny that I behave like a good friend.
<p>After all, I did go and buy bread to meet the boys' request, and even after that I was still being treated like a sandbag as everyday <p>stress relief.
<p>"Alright!"
<p>"Good!"
<p>The person confronting me punches me in the belly.
<p>"Ha ha! Hoo!"
<p>"Ha ha ha! It feels really good! I feel refreshing!"
<p>"Oh, are you going to start the next lesson?"
<p>"Would you like to go there again?" Sure then, Pig! "
<p>The male students left the place while laughing.
<p>"Huh ... ...!"
<p>If I manage to stand up somehow while the pain abates, I will not fall to my knees and to the ground.
<p>"Haa ... ... huh ...... “

<p>Then somebody touched my face, and I expectied more pain.
<p>"Hey, Hiiragi!"

<p>A girl student came up to me.
<p>"Are you okay? "

<p>Brown hair falling on her shoulders. A headband on her head. Two big eyes, overwhelming and black. The lips were fresh and smelled of cherry.
<p>The girl looking at my face anxiously was one of the most beautiful in this school. Next class's.
<p>There are very few people who do not mind my body odor and would think about touching me.
<p>"Can you stand up?"
<p>"Oh, ah..."

<p>She went to me without any hesitation, so I think that this Hino girl is very kind-hearted.
By the way, I am not so stupid to misjudge the situation and build up false expectations, just because she was a little kind with me. Telling me this makes me sad!
<p>"Hiiragi, what happened?"
<p>"...  It's not like Hino cares, so I guess if you do not go to the classroom, you will be late for the next lesson?"
<p>"Oh... yeah, that's right, but..."

<p>"Let's go quickly, but Hino would be better to move away from me.

<p>"Why?"
<p>"Because someone else might misunderstand the situation, and I do not want to involve Hino."

<p>"Huh?"
<p>As I said so, I ignored the pain in my body and began moving before Hino.
<p>Hino seems to be really worried about me, but if you are so worried, you will get into troubles. Well, that's why Hino is a popular person, but I did not want such a nice gal to get involved, so I acted accordingly.
<p>Thus, after the following classes, the lessons were over for everyone, and everyone was on their way back home.
<p>Dling dlong – dling dlong.
<p>Suddenly the broadcast rang.
<p>"To all the students of the school, please stop all actions and sit down."
<p>Something was broadcasted, but I couldn't translate it in my language.
<p>Everyone stopped for a moment, and while I was tilting my head, everyone else was sitting in great anticipation.
<p>"Well!"

<p>"What, my body...?!? "

<p>I remember that I was preparing for returning, but due to something invisible I was suddenly forced to sit down.
<p>"I don't understand what's happening..."

<p>I didn't get what was going on, so I tried to stand up again...
<p>"Wait, I can't move!"

<p>"What is going on!? "

<p>I could not move as if I was tied to the chair.
<p>No matter how much I tried to shake, I couldn't move a muscle.
<p>It seemed as if everybody were really tied to their chair.
<p>While everybody in all the classes were hesitant, the broadcast was played again.
<p>"Hi, everyone. I am saying "God" in your world"
<p>A mysterious voice that didn't conform to any type of voice, of either young or old, came from the speaker.
<p>"You seem to be confused by the sudden situation, right? When cryptic things happen, humans can not keep calm. This is why human beings are pathetic and comical creatures."
<p>I did not know exactly what he was saying. A human? Besides, the Lord of this voice called himself a god.
<p>If you are seriously saying this under normal circumstances, you are probably already completely nuts.
<p>However, we were now forced to sit down due to an unknown power, and we couldn't move at all, without anything really wrapping up our bodies.
<p>That is why the strange authenticity in the word of God of this broadcast was building up in me.
<p>"It is complicated to explain every detail to people like you guys, so I will explain it briefly."
<p>The voice coming from the speaker sounded somewhat amused.


<p>"From now on, you will go to a different world from this planet - another world"</p>

<p>Hope You Like It!</p>
