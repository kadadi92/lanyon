<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>After leaving his sister, Lingyun returns to his dormitory, Lingyun realizes that his throat is really dry. His body&rsquo;s got completely dehydrated.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>He quickly drinks half a pot of water. He then shuts the curtains and gets undressed.</span> <!--more--> <span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;I'm all wet, I'm going to take a shower, I smell horribly.&quot; He goes straight to the showers.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyun frowns, takes all the bath supplies and goes straight to the water room.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Fifteen minutes later, Lingyu finally finishes washing himself. He takes off his clothes to the basin to soak and comes back to the dormitory wearing slippers.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>He realizes that the pants he has washed the previous night have yet to dry...</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;I'm screwed...&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>He looks for something, rummaging through the boxes to find it, </span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>he remembers that while searching for money he saw a sky-blue colored cloth.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&ldquo;I know there is always a way&rdquo; Ha Ha. My memory is powerful ah!</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyun finally takes out from the closet that set of uniforms which have not been worn for a long time. He looks through them and they are all clean. He directly puts them on.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>This is probably the legendary uniforms, right? Martial art mark ! it&rsquo;s a bit small&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>He puts his last seventy yuan in his pocket, and he leaves the dormitory to meet Ning Lingyu downstairs.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>After getting out of the boys&rsquo; dormitory. He gives a casual glance at the girls' dormitory, and there is amazement in everyone&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>So beautiful !</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Ning Ling Yu has also just come out from the dormitory building.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>It has been ages since Lingyu had something to eat with her brother, but when he spoke to her in the playground, she felt like nothing at all had changed.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>His eyes are still loving and protective towards her. He is still a little lifeless when he speaks to her, but he is trying to be more funny now.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Today Lingyun has even invited her to have something to eat together, and to Lingyu that means that things are going back the way they were six years ago.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>So she&rsquo;s taken the most real, the most beautiful, the most lovely dress. She wants to be at her absolute best with her brother.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>She&rsquo;s taken a bath. She thinks of not wanting to wear the daily routine dress so she dresses up with white shirt and blue pants.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Today the weather is nice, the sky is clear without a hint of clouds, the sun is warm and bright. </span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Ning Lingyu comes out of the girls&rsquo; dormitory, in the dazzling sun that shines toward Lingyun. </span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>The sunlight shines on her, making her look like a goddess descended from heavens.</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Brother? Brother!&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyu reaches out for Lingyun, who has been staring at nothing, then she shakes her hand in front of his face.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Yes...?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; Lingyu makes a rhetorical question.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Nothing...&quot; Lingyun feels embarrassed, and blushes.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Do I look good?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;You look good, gorgeous...&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Even better than Cao Shanshan?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Whoever this Cao Shanshan is, you are a thousand times more beautiful than her...&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Ning Lingyu laughs, satisfied, and reaches out for his brother's arm. Then, they head to the canteen together.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Brother, why are you wearing the uniform? Nobody wears it anymore,&quot; she asks.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyun is feeling the scent and the strength emanating from her body, and he can&rsquo;t stay focused.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Is that Ning Lingyu's boyfriend? Look at the way she holds his arm.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;No, he's her brother, the guy who ran ten laps in the playground with a sandbag on his shoulders!&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;But they are not actually brother and sister, aren&rsquo;t they? They have different parents...&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Hey, &#160;have you seen Lingyun and Ning Lingyu?&quot; The two guys who are talking suddenly hear a loud voice from behind their back, so they turn around and see a hardy boy.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Tang Meng has just withdrawn the ten thousand yuan.</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Boss Tang, they entered the canteen just a moment ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyun certainly doesn&rsquo;t want to tell his sister about the car crash of the night before. He has come up with a plausible explanation: last night, after his self-study lesson, he went running, and he found somebody who fell in the water. Having to help that person, he carried him home and gave him his jacket to shield him from the cold. Everything makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Lingyu is suspicious: &quot;If you did a good deed, and everybody is saying mean things about you, why don't you justify yourself?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Justify? No, justifying myself is not my style. The only person in the world I have to justify myself with, is my little sister!&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Then, brother, when we're done eating, give me all your dirty clothes and I'll wash them for you; you never clean them properly,&quot; says Lingyu.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Brother has only a couple of outfits, I have to save some money to buy him more clothes&quot; she thinks to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>But then she remembers she has given her last 500 yuan to Tang Meng, and she regrets it. She will have to borrow some money to her classmates. Of course she won&rsquo;t tell this to Lingyun, because she is afraid he might get angry. In regards to the chances of winning, she didn't even consider it possible.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>She is thinking about all of that, while looking at her brother.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Sister, why did you bring me here? The food is not great here.&quot; Lingyun is browsing the chaotic canteen with his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;I don't have money issues, let's go to the second floor&quot; there is a nice restaurant on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Roasted meat, ribs with sweet and sour sauce, chicken with mushrooms...&quot; listening to all the dishes Lingyu has ordered, Lingyun feels a bit worried.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>He doesn&rsquo;t have the money for all of that!</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>But he doesn&rsquo;t want to let his sister down, and besides he likes as well all the dishes she is ordering.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Surely Lingyu brought some money too...&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;I have to find a way to earn some money, or I won't survive much longer...&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Riiiiiiing&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>The bell rings, signaling the beginning of the last lesson. At the same time, Tang Meng has just reached the second floor. He usually eats there, the waiters know him well.</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;Hello Tang Meng, welcome, what do you want today?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>&quot;I'll tell you in a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Tang Meng goes straight to Lingyun's table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hey, fatty, today you really impressed me. You ran 4,400 meters with a 50 pounds bag. Are you possessed or something?"</span></p>
