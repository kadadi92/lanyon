<p>Tang Meng seems to have long been expected to Xie Junyan certainly, so he smiled, thumbs pointing to the direction of the playground, in a leisurely way: "Since Xie little interest, you should quickly bet…” “Well, but the fat man has already run a half - circle, can you bet how much he can run?”</p>

<p>All of the students want to bet and are breathtakingly staring at Xie Junyan. Obviously, we are more convinced of his judgment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Xie Junyan did not speak, but his eyes fell on the playground where Lingyun ran, careful observation of his pace, his movements, his breathing, and even his eyes, it looks like horse racing….</p>

<p>With his observation, Xie Junyan brow wrinkled more and more tightly, his face has become extremely complex.</p>

<p>Tang Meng saw him so he could not help sneer ridiculed: "Xie big boy, you think this is a horse horse? Also I observed you for so long, do not lose, do not play, a lot of people are waiting to bet for it!</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Xie Junyan can not help listening to the brow of Xuan, he suddenly retreated from the slow Lingyun eyes, his look had a leisurely smile, then he said: "This year, people run as horses, when we will bet to horses directly? Yuan, bet four laps! "</p>

<p>"W-What?……"</p>

<p>"What, dude, Xie Junyan even betting Lingyun can carry sandbags for four laps, but that is 1600 meters ah!</p>

<p>"Finis hit boy, Xie Junyan judge it should be less, I bet he can ran a lap… Hah, lost!"</p>

<p>Onlookers of the students are in an uproar, some of them do not believe Lingyun really can run for four laps, someone lost at the expense of his life, so be grateful for Xie Junyan if Lingyun feel incredible!</p>

<p>Zhuangmei Na had just smashed two thousand dollars gambling on Lingyun up to run a circle, which Xie Junyan Lingyun thinks now he can even run four laps, this is not ridicoulus?</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>She is not distressed that they lose the two thousand dollars, but worried that in front of so many people lost their face!</p>

<p>"Well, four laps? 1600 meters to the other end with that fat pig? Even if he did not carry the sandbag he can’t run three laps on the Guards!" Zhuangmei Na though know Xie Junyan certainly will not dig their own bet, but still Can not help but express his contempt!</p>

<p>Tang Meng heard this is a big deal, but he could not help but twitching his eyes.</p>

<p>Since the so-called small God of Gamblers, he set the odds of gambling before the natural setting, it’s not blind shouting, and he carefully observed Lingyun running posture and movement, for four laps, and happened to judge him!</p>

<p>As for more than five laps ... ... That is purely insane, if not with specialized training, who can carry 50 kg of sandbags for two kilometers?</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Although this Xie Junyan pinch seven inches, Tang Meng quietly said: "Xie,with four times the odds, won over 20,000, does it seems to you that this time to bet on Ben Lee? "</p>

<p>Xie Junyan has long observed that the moment of the Tang Meng, he seems confident, fainted a chuckle: "Come and do not be indecent also, last time you earned me a million, this time I get back 10,000, It 's just a draw ... I do not have to take cash?</p>
<br />
<br />


<p>Tang Meng chuckled: "I believe it, but thank you big, Zhao Lei, accounting, Xie Junyan won five thousand dollars, on a bet of four laps!"</p>

<p>"Good le!" Tang Meng's younger brother Zhao Lei rushed to the small book.</p>

<p>Before he finished, Tang Meng forced a breath, and casually shouted around: "There is no gambling?</p>

<p>"I bet a thousand dollars, bet to five to ten laps!" Cao Shan Shan Qing Kai shut his lips, the voice is clear-cut.</p>

<p>"Ah ?! ... ..." a lot of students are blankly looking at Cao Shanshan, his face is incredible!</p>

<p>And even Xie Junyan listened, his face slightly embarrassed….</p>

<p>How can he be so sure that Lingyun can run more than five laps!</p>

<p>Among them, especially in Ling Ling and Ling Ling Yu even!</p>

<p>"Shanshan, you will not be a cheater, right? You look at Lingyun that way, he is not even able run twice on the field ah, but five laps?" Zhang Ling anxious to pull up on Caoshan Shanshan sleeves hurried to persuade him.
</p>
<br />
<br />


<p>"Cao’s big school bet a thousand dollars, gambling on Lingyun for five to ten laps! Win with a compensation of five thousand dollars!" Tang Meng's grinned, this is to lose money for sure!</p>

<p>In fact, it is not the amount of money the problem, thinking the high school can spend thousand dollars, in the future he has also boasted the Tang Meng capital, that is, can bet a dreamy amount of money.</p>

<p>Ning Ling Yu Shan Shan Shan at this time looked blankly, but also feel that they have not heard it wrong!</p>

<p>Can Cao Shanshan even think so much of his brother? It is this morning rumors ...</p>

<p>Tang Meng grinning quickly to his little brother Zhao Lei on the account, but did not mean to Cao Shanshan money, and then he suddenly raised his hand a means of playground.</p>

<p>"Students, look at the momentum of this fat man, he certainly is to make use of feeding effort to run, but there will be a few minutes to class -" Here, he glanced at all, continue Said: "If we believe that my betting is good, I see now Tang Meng that went up to the playground, to help Lingyun a few laps!</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />


<p>"As for everyone, you should go back to class, until the end of the next class, I will tell you how many run Lingyun did in the end!</p>

<p>"Of course, if I do not worry about the next bet, I can follow along with me skipping a few laps to go!"</p>

<p>Tang Meng said it was very high-sounding, can be finished, he put his eyes on Xie Junyan face.</p>

<p>That means it is very obvious, Xie Junyan cast the biggest note, he is back to class, or with their own playground to a few laps.</p>

<p>Xie Junyan smile shaking his head "Who do not believe that Tang Meng is betting goods? Circle is a few laps, to the number of laps of this kind of thing, I am not interested ... ... "</p>

<p>Finished, Cao Shanshan smile, nodded his head, we must pull Zhuangmei back to the classroom.</p>

<p>Tang Meng Gang want everyone to disperse, but a cold voice shouted:</p>

<p>"Slow!"</p>

<p>The students just wanted to go back to class, but suddenly to the interest, they have stopped see the source of the sound.</p>

<p>I saw Ning Ling Yu Dai Mei micro-wrinkles, gently move forward a step, cut Shuang Hitang Tang Meng: "Tang Meng, since you take my brother to open gambling, I would also like to gamble ,OK?"</p>

<p>Tang Meng boldly though, he can take people's brother to gamble, people sister to come to, he really a little embarrassed, he secretly like Ning Lingyu that one!</p>

<p>Tang Meng is a bit guilty, he does not naturally scratch his head, hey lose lost smiles: "Hey, Ningling rain, you do not misunderstand, in fact, I play, no other meaning ... ..."</p>

<p>"I do not care what you mean!" Ning Ling rain face is still cold, she took out his wallet directly only five hundred dollars, raised his hand and handed them to Tang Meng.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>"You listen to good, five hundred, bet my brother can run more than ten laps!" Ning Ling Yu did not hide his anger in the eyes, she knew her money must go back, but she did not care!</p>

<p>Corridor is a surprise!</p>

<p>"Ten laps? This ... it's impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes ah ah, carrying fifty pounds of sandbags run four thousand meters? This is not to write fantasy novels ... ..."</p>

<p>"To say special forces, I believe, can Lingyun Well, Ha ha ha ... ..."</p>

<p>For a time exclaimed everywhere, talking about!</p>
<br />
<br />


<p>"Ning Ling Yu, Keke ... ... I tell you, although this is gambling play, can really lose, the money is not refundable, you can not make a grudge ... ..." Tang Meng Lingling rain family to know, so he And did not take over the money Lingling, but he kept advised.</p>

<p>Xie Lingyan also looked at Ning Lingyu: "Ning Lingyu, your brother can not run more than 10 laps, you do throw money ... ... Tang Meng is a meat-spitting bone…. “ “ I have to say Xie Junyan is a belly black master….”</p>

<p>Cao Shanshan is silent, a pair of beautiful eyes, such as autumn eyes quietly looked Ning Ling Yu, secretly admire the courage of the girl.</p><br />
<br />
<p>A very discordant voice cynical sounded: "I said that Xie Junyan, right? People are willing to take money for her brother to play, you know? Even grandmother threw in two thousand … "</p>

<p>In this case, If not for Xie Junyan power, Zhuangmei Na would have already shouted for the abuse!</p>

<p>Ning Ling Yu ignored Chuang Mei Na, she put the five hundred dollars in the heavy Tang Meng's hands, and turned to go to their classroom.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Seems to see the favorite children in the eyes of anger and resentment, Tang Meng also some could not hang, he looked uncertain, readily put the five hundred dollars thrown into the hands of Zhao Lei, impatiently said: , I'm going to playground, and want to see it by myself!</p>

<p>Regardless of Zhao Lei, she went to the stairs.</p>

<p>He'd want to see for yourself, Lingyun in the end to run the number of laps!</p>

<p>"Bells ... ..."</p>

<p>Tang Menggang out of the classroom building, they heard the school bell rang, but skipping for him is simply routine, he do not care.</p>

<p>Lingyun in the end can persist for a long time, can he run a few laps?</p>
