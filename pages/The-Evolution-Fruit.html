<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seiichi Hiiragi had such a terrible appearance that negative adjectives such as ugly, unpleasant,

dirty, smelly, and deb, were thrown at him non-stop. Seiichi was constantly bullied at school, and

every day he just waited to go back home. One day, all of a sudden a voice from the broadcast

speaker said that he were to be transferred to a different world; the voice came from a God itself.

That would not concern Seiichi alone, but his whole school. They would go to a fantasy world

where levels, standings, skills and similar things existed, as if in a game. However, the God

wouldn't do all of that on its own volition, but because people from the other world were

performing summoning rituals in order to conjure brave man and women to their world. While all

the classes were forming a group waiting to be transfereed, of all of his classmates Seiichi alone

was rejected, and sent to a different place entirely. For the first time in his life, once reached his

destination, he would eat the “Evolution Fruit”. That experience would drastically change Seiichi

's life.</p>

<p>This story is about Seiichi being rejected by his classmates. At the end of the fairy tale his

struggles are rewarded, he survives that new world, eventually prooving to be a winner.</p>
