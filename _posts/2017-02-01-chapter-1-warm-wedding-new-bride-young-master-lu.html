<p>Su Jian An came out from the toilet after washed her hands. A pair of man and woman were caught off guard by her.</p> 

<p>It was the popular Han Ruo Xi and the president of Lu's family, Lu Bao Yan!</p> 

<p>She quickly ran and hide behind the wall and was peeking at them. </p>

<p>"I heard that she was just a forensic. How could you be her man?" </p>

<p>Han Ruo Xi watched Lu Bao Yan's face looked calm. She felt that she was betrayed by him.</p>

<p>Su Jian An was murmuring by herself: "So what if I am just a forensic? It is a pretty cool job these days, alright?!"
Lu Bao Yan seemed loosen up his face: "I will divorce her in two years."</p>

<p>He still wanted to marry that woman.

<p>Han Ruo Xi's lips curled up and laugh bitterly: "Alright, then."

<p>She wore her sunglass and walked away. Lu Bao Yan also headed towards the private room.

<p>Su Jian An slowly came out and blinked her eyes: "Both of them really suits each other, huh?"

<p>Once Han Ruo Xi began popular, she and Lu Bao Yan had rumors but they didn't admit they loved each other.

<p>She wanted to reveal it but it won't do anything good for her. Then she was walking to the private room. She pushed the door and Lu Bao Yan was there.

<p>She had to admit that this man was really handsome. He looked like a child of God. He had a pair of deep and narrow eyes, a straight nose, and a sexy thin lips. He looked so perfect like no other man. He had a strong build body, a gorgeous aura and charming. Even a success and proud woman like Han Ruo Xi could even felt to his knee.

<p>Tang Yu Lan patted her son: "Bao Yan, don't you think Jian An is more beautiful in these years?"

<p>Lu Bao Yan silenced and looked at her. He just smirked.

<p>Su Jian An touched her nose, politely laughed away and came to her brother, Su Yi Cheng.

<p>She bite her chopsticks. She regretted that she didn't took a picture of them having a conversation.

<p>Su Yi Cheng slightly touched Su Jian An's hand: "This is your wedding party. Please behave."

<p>Su Jian An was the woman that is going to marry him tomorrow. She was just a forensic. Just a minute ago she saw them having a conversation together. He even promised Han Ruo Xi that he will divorce Su Jian An. Her new life was so different.

<p>Tang Yu Lan knew that Lu Bao Yan and Su Jian An haven't met for fourteen years so they felt unfamiliar towards each other. She let them to have a private time: "Jian An, I have booked the presidential package upstairs. Both of you stay here tonight and prepare for tomorrow. Yi Cheng, sorry to trouble you but can you send me home?"

<p>Su Yi Cheng immediately pulled Tang Yu Lan's chair and said: "Bao Yan, don't worry. I will take Auntie Tang to home safely."
Su Yi Cheng was a handsome and a mature man. He never speak in hurry. He always stable and calm. For Su Jian An, he is the world's finest and dependable man. Of course, she didn't have to worry having him to take Tang Yu Lan to home.

<p>But, is this the time for her to be lonely?

<p>Tang Yu Lan patted Su Jian An's hand: "Jian An, you don't to be so nervous."

<p>Su Jian An just smiled.

<p>She had met with Lu Bao Yan when she was ten years old. After that, they didn't meet each other again when Lu Bao Yan went abroad. It's been fourteen years until today. 

<p>Tang Yu Lan left her last words before went home: "Bao Yan, protect Jian An. You will be her husband starting tomorrow. You will live forever with her."

<p>She said her words and left with Su Yi Cheng. There were only Lu Bao Yan and Su Jian An in the private room.

<p>Su Jian An was thinking what he said to Han Ruo Xi------- He will divorce her after two years.

<p>She was not sure she could live forever with Lu Bao Yan.

<p>They didn't speak anything. There was silence in the air.

<p>"Why did you agree to marry me?"

<p>After some time, Lu Bao Yan coughed.

<p>"Hm?" Su Jian An just realized, "DIdn't Aunty Tang tell you? My father wanted to kidnap me and threatened my brother and Aunty Tang wanted me to marry you. My father won't dare to make any troubles with me if I become your wife. With this, my brother can do what he wants."

Was this enough to answer his question? 

<p>"Let's go back to our room." Lu Bao Yan coldly commanded.

<p>Su Jian An startled and asked: "What for?"

<p>Lu Bao Yan narrowed his lips: "Just come with me. What do you think we can do in our room?"

<p>A charming and calm demanding voice came out from the noble man.

<p>Su Jian An welcomed her new life.
