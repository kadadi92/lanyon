<h1> Chapter 1 - To a New World </h1>
This is my name. I am a second grade student going to a special high school.<br />
Even if it is special, it is not a place where people have cartoon-like abilities, or frequented by<br />
<gs id="3c21ced0-2e3b-4b45-b4e7-414b4e70c62f" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="fa5c71d5-e56f-4641-841c-529775fc85ed" >aliens</gs>.<br />
It is rather a so-called idol training school...<br />
<br />
Famous school girl and boy idols go to the same school where I go.<br />
<br />
But do I look anything like them? If you asked that, the answer would be “no”. Not even close.<br />
Luckily, at least I'm not bald. But I'm pretty <gs id="25c0a3ed-cc93-41f7-9bba-60f71d355bef" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="2508e9c3-43ae-49db-ae0c-271ca20dbe34" >uggly</gs>, and I smell terribly.<br />
<br />
Once I <gs id="f85ddd3b-a598-43f9-b63d-ff152e9acfe7" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="9b0800c0-334f-4be5-b9ce-6c9705076a8c" >smelled</gs> so much, that I didn't dare to sit at my desk. Not even when the other students, and<br />

<br />
I am such a celebrity that everyone knows me at school... <gs id="e5921fc7-bce6-4755-b6c8-4cd6ab2331bc" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="2e9a7f13-d5a9-4522-ad92-889a610fad92" >in</gs> a bad way.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I recently started to gain weight. I weighted 70kg when I arrived, but now I'm around<br />
100kg. I think well of myself, but I can never live up to it.<br />
<br />
I began getting fat after my parents passed away in an accident, and my happy days ended. It is the<br />

Some say that a true person owns <gs id="24c2bc02-db20-40e5-8d96-8ab59050d74c" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="e8695a76-a248-46e0-9330-1e502474d6d7" >itself</gs>. Should I ask mom and<br />

<br />
As far as the looks are concerned, I can say that I have already given up, but it is my name that I<br />

<br />
No, Seiichi is cool as of sounds and letters, but my appearance isn't, so there is no point in<br />
<gs id="e0ed731c-7a20-4e1d-8314-980e9da320d6" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="c84505fc-cb33-4cc3-9a38-4a16c083dad6" >changing</gs> my name. To the extent that you want to become a pedestal for the whole world <gs id="bdf005ef-3192-4be7-bd3c-e4aa2de7863d" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="91bd4ef0-4c25-4614-b281-c7fb5b01a880" >to</gs><br />

<br />
Why am I like this? Well, if you go to a school like mine, it's obvious you get burned. It may not<br />
<gs id="f372c27b-8ed7-46f3-8c9c-a02824052de3" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="5975fd92-927a-4bdd-a547-f81a88ec08e6" >be</gs> an exaggeration to say that it is the center of the world.<br />
<br />
So, why am I in this school? We are getting <gs id="e25af50a-94c2-42bb-af44-29629ca78090" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="801df164-3d16-4b2e-b626-4121a818b7ca" >to</gs> it.<br />
<br />
It is because the school is very close to my house, and because it is a school where you can enter<br />
<gs id="876fadd4-74d1-46fc-b589-dc77c9fbdf63" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="a376adf1-8515-401b-bc01-8f6b71cc99b4" >even</gs> if your scores are not that good. Even ordinary people like me can go to this school as if it<br />

<br />
Isn't it useless? Well, if you want to have a laugh it's funny! I am reflecting and regretting at the<br />

<br />
But really, I will admit that I hate myself, for convenience, but I don't care about the bullies. I<br />

<br />
There is a really profound reason why he has been doing such a long self-explanation.<br />
This monologue is also necessary to keep his sanity.<br />
So why are you doing this?<br />
<br />
It dates back to some time ago...<br />
<br />
◆◇◆<br />
<br />
"Hey, <gs id="bdb51453-dd97-4885-848b-fc2a2bdfb389" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="613ff73c-f1bf-444e-9263-e773c5d313b6" >pigeye</gs>! Go buy some bread!"<br />
<br />
"Of course, put that money to good use!"<br />
<br />
<gs id="f5750482-30b9-4a97-9401-7f5632157edc" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="1ba8311f-977a-4fd5-a34c-ae3935bc76dd" >Gahahahaha</gs> Ha!<br />
<br />
Along with these laughter, I was called names by several of the boys in the back of the gym,<br />
<gs id="cdd6cf01-ca2d-4141-a103-f53c13f5078c" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="214e8d51-0e01-4aa3-b319-9f49d8ec59a2" >students</gs> during the lunch break, and I was there listening.<br />
<br />
Well, well, there are truly amazing people at this school... There are also nation idols and<br />
<gs id="b586f244-e69a-48db-af37-10ed21ad77d2" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="b32abdaa-8b75-45b0-83ab-4427bf67114a" >somewhat</gs> famous persons. While me, I am nothing compared to them.<br />
<br />
However, I <gs id="a2ee3d3f-ea1b-4e12-b05e-e61e38aa2a05" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="61a3d98b-e7be-45da-8f19-ed9ef892d505" >can not</gs> deny that I behave like a good friend.<br />
<br />
After all, I did go and buy bread to meet the boys' request, and even after that I was still being<br />
<gs id="b7b5f5a9-29d4-416d-94d5-154bfe35f15b" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="584c7d2e-1dc9-4f87-bb2c-2abf40991b87" >treated</gs> like a sandbag as everyday stress relief.<br />
<br />
"Alright!"<br />
<br />
"Good!"<br />
<br />
The person confronting me punches me in the belly.<br />
<br />
"Ha ha! <gs id="3c34bc73-97be-4512-a18d-f5473160c4b9" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="6a0388c3-693d-427b-bf63-bc7058cf0ab7" >Hoo</gs>!"<br />
"Ha ha ha! It feels really good! I feel refreshing!"<br />
<br />
"Oh, are you going to start the next lesson?"<br />
<br />
"Would you like to go there again?" Sure then, Pig! "<br />
<br />
The male students left the place while laughing.<br />
<br />
"Huh<gs id="a8d37cbc-def7-46c7-8f5d-b9372402d1e0" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="f36b7f10-999b-40a0-b664-2602c6352aa4" > .</gs>..<gs id="b4d22c95-a101-40b3-90e5-d78566207c50" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="f36b7f10-999b-40a0-b664-2602c6352aa4" > .</gs>..!"<br />
<br />
If I manage to stand up somehow while the pain abates, I will not fall to my knees and to the<br />
<gs id="57458165-8869-4999-bf8d-e97130e939d0" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="bee2ffb7-da93-44ca-a76d-800c95423ffb" >ground</gs>.<br />
<br />
"<gs id="7d608614-30ce-4101-b3c1-396ed0482a40" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="d6f54441-745b-4471-8229-706b8cba9a48" >Haa</gs><gs id="41505ef9-3792-44c7-9ce0-744b285dc0b0" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="d6f54441-745b-4471-8229-706b8cba9a48" > ... ...</gs> <gs id="9a6edab3-81ee-4b5a-93db-8d1c4a0b86c7" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="b05ca595-6e95-4383-b5f6-f8b50f45634f" >huh</gs><gs id="685912e4-e519-4864-97a7-795a1ed10311" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="b05ca595-6e95-4383-b5f6-f8b50f45634f" > ......</gs> “<br />
<br />
Then somebody touched my face, and I <gs id="be147cde-d929-40fa-b8e4-14ec78131658" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="e700c7f6-950d-40d2-b96d-14a714c7a8bd" >expectied</gs> more pain.<br />
<br />
"Hey, Hiiragi!"<br />
<br />
A girl student came up to me.<br />
<br />
"Are you okay? "<br />
<br />
Brown hair falling on her shoulders. A headband on her head. Two big eyes, overwhelming and<br />
<gs id="de282557-fa8c-4ff3-8a58-2e00381d01dd" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="d0973e1d-7295-4835-89a8-7f8596adea5b" >black</gs>. The lips were fresh and smelled of cherry.<br />
<br />
The girl looking at my face anxiously was one of the most beautiful in this school. Next class's.<br />
There are very few people who do not mind my body odor and would think about touching me.<br />
<br />
"Can you stand up?"<br />
<br />
"Oh, ah..."<br />
<br />
She went to me without any hesitation, so I think that this Hino girl is very kind-hearted.<br />
By the way, I am not so stupid to misjudge the situation and build up false expectations, just<br />
<gs id="a5d68394-109f-4e22-8b24-c6531a47b232" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="03dd8c2b-a76e-46a4-97d3-1199a54bbecd" >because</gs> she was a little kind <gs id="b41b2337-a669-46b6-83aa-6b28628e697c" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="03dd8c2b-a76e-46a4-97d3-1199a54bbecd" >with</gs> me. Telling me this makes me sad!<br />
<br />
"Hiiragi, what happened?"<br />
<br />
"... It's not like Hino cares, so I guess if you do not go to the classroom, you will be late for the<br />
<gs id="de893ef6-1a95-4398-b71c-e16464a30385" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="c429c2b8-b197-4d97-b37c-50810366be30" >next</gs> lesson?"<br />
<br />
"Oh... <gs id="1be63639-ad41-4e27-aa48-001f1f219bb7" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="6a43e34a-a92a-485d-a7c8-39c69556b822" >yeah</gs>, that's right, but..."<br />
<br />
"Let's go quickly, but Hino would be better to move away from me.<br />
<br />
"Why?"<br />
<br />
"Because someone else might misunderstand the situation, and I do not want to involve Hino."<br />
<br />
"Huh?"<br />
<br />
As I said so, I ignored the pain in my body and began moving before Hino.<br />
<br />
Hino seems to be really worried about me, but if you are so worried, you will get into troubles.<br />
<br />
Well, that's why Hino is a popular person, but I did not want such a nice gal to get involved, so I<br />
<gs id="08c23152-a04a-40e3-9606-2eb9857c41da" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="82471d5f-f4a5-4b06-b1cc-103e0a1e9cf1" >acted</gs> accordingly.<br />
<br />
Thus, after the following classes, the lessons were over for everyone, and everyone was on their<br />
<gs id="79c395dc-b6d6-4be9-9443-8044e5ddc50d" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="705460db-71d1-45f4-8af1-c763edfad189" >way</gs> back home.<br />
Dling dlong – dling dlong.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the broadcast rang.<br />
<br />
"To all the students of the school, please stop all actions and sit down."<br />
<br />
Something was broadcasted, but I couldn't translate it in my language.<br />
<br />
Everyone stopped for a moment, and while I was tilting my head, everyone else was sitting in great<br />
<gs id="b46e0398-b196-4a47-9cd2-21811621973b" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="b7341066-84d1-4a35-b6c3-f907f8492310" >anticipation</gs>.<br />
<br />
"Well!"<br />
<br />
"What, my body...?!? "<br />
I remember that I was preparing for returning, but due to something invisible I was suddenly forced to sit down.<br />
"I don't understand what's happening..."<br />
<br />
I didn't get what was going on, so I tried to stand up again...<br />
<br />
"Wait, I can't move!"<br />
<br />
"What is going on!? "<br />
<br />
I could not move as if I was tied to the chair.<br />
<br />
No matter how much I tried to shake, I couldn't move a muscle.<br />
<br />
It seemed as if everybody were really tied to their <gs id="6975f466-f6bc-4262-82ba-e6eff3d08096" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="5a47504d-867c-48a3-b504-da481e160795" >chair</gs>.<br />
<br />
While everybody in all the classes <gs id="ac2eb661-1049-4597-8ae3-ec738f5c30d9" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="dea4d5f1-8988-4292-a4a2-ab26704a87c1" >were</gs> hesitant, the broadcast was played again.<br />
<br />
"Hi, everyone. I am saying "God" in your world"<br />
<br />
A mysterious voice that didn't conform to any type of voice, of either young or old, came from the<br />
<gs id="a0cf2379-3623-4881-ae06-13c153186031" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="ab24d104-13e6-4a34-9564-0196e478b4ef" >speaker</gs>.<br />
<br />
"You seem to be confused by the sudden situation, right? When cryptic things happen, humans can<br />

<br />
I did not know exactly what he was saying. A human? Besides, the Lord of this voice called<br />
<gs id="5ea96cce-5e55-4320-b7dc-8f930d963d39" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="cb3dcd44-0598-4ca8-9a52-dee601598375" >himself</gs> a god.<br />
<br />
If you are seriously saying this under normal circumstances, you are probably already <gs id="f4c92973-fd20-42a4-958c-279e928c7ed1" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="1c2f8ff5-52eb-4545-b6b4-03e152010e21" >completely</gs><br />

<br />
However, we were now forced to sit down due to an unknown power, and we couldn't move at all,<br />
<gs id="21ba2f4b-b054-4e6c-aaee-6f3ecb6a60ec" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="6af31506-de79-475a-8551-d75a29ffaa7d" >without</gs> anything really wrapping up our bodies.<br />
<br />
That is why the strange authenticity in the word of God of this broadcast was building up in me.<br />
<br />
"It is complicated to explain every detail to people like you guys, so I will explain it briefly."<br />
<br />
The voice coming from the speaker sounded somewhat amused.<br />
<br />
"From now on, you will go to a different world from this planet - another world"
