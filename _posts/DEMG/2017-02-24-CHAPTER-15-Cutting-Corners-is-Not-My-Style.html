<p><a name="result_box"></a>"Ah...oh Good..." seeing that Lingyun wants to lift himself up, Ning Lingyu tries to help him, but she raised upto half and accidentally drops the sandbag on the pavement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Lingyu is even more impressed, and only now she fully realizes with what kind of weight his brother just ran for more than 4400 meters.</p>

<p>Lingyun stretches his arms and legs for a moment, and seeing the lovely expression on his little sister's face, he kindly says "Leave it to me!", and he bends to pick up the bag.</p>

<p>"Lingyun, you have hidden your true self well! Even I was wrong in judging you!" Ma Tinagfeng is right there just behind, he is smiling at both bother and sister. </p>

<p>"Good morning, teacher Ma Tinagfeng!" the beautiful face of Lingyu blushes slightly, she feels a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>She never missed a lesson before, and now she's here during school time; even if Ma Tinagfeng is only a Physical Education teacher, he's still a teacher!</p>

<p>Ma Tianfeng smiles and nods to Lingyu, and then he talks seriously to Lingyun: "Lingyun, I know that your grades are not good, but I saw your performance before. Would you like to train with me for two months, and then sign up at the University of Sports Science as a student-athlete?"</p>

<p>At first Lingyu is worried for his brother on hearing Ma's words, but when she understands he's calm, she feels calm as well.</p>

<p>She don't want her elder brother to being hit pieces, once again sink down.</p>

<p>He's right, with those grades, his brother would definitely not be able to enter the University, so it's not a bad idea everything considered.</p>

<p>But Lingyun's answer shatters the hopes of both of them: "Going to the University of Sports Science would be like cutting corners, and I'm not interested in doing that!"</p>

<p>Ma Tianfeng is surprised of Lingyun's negative answer, because the day before that boy wouldn't have even dared to stare at his face. But, knowing about Lingyun's incredible talent, Ma doesn't give up.</p>

<p>"Lingyun, don't you look at it that way, you're really talented as an athlete. Even though two months are not a long time, I'm sure you would make it; weight lifting, shot put, discus throw, judo, you could easily do any of those!"</p>

<p>He has seen the potential of Lingyun, who is 1,80 meters tall and weights over 100 kilos.</p>

<p>But he doesn't know that Lingyun's goal is already that of losing 30 kilos.</p>

<p>"Brother, teacher Ma is right..." Lingyu says in a serious voice.</p>

<p>"No, I will not cut corners, it's not my style... I want to get into University the normal way..."</p>

<p>"The normal way?" Ma Tianfeng laughs.</p>

<p>"With your grades, you hope to be admitted to the university? Even if you want to dream, you have to face reality."</p>

<p>Hearing Linguyn say “not my style” one more time, Lingyu feels like laughing, but then she doesn't, being afraid that her brother might read that as a mockery.</p>

<p>She studies like crazy, and every single time she gets the highest mark in the class, because she wants to be admitted to the best University. That way, she will find a good job and make her mother proud, and she will be able to take care of her brother.</p>

<p>She wishes for his brother to be admitted at the University as well, but she knows very well that going from being the worst student of the school to entering university in only two months is pure daydreaming.</p>

<p>Ma Tianfeng understands that Lingyun won't pay attention to him, so he shakes his head and says: "I'll give you three days to think over it, and then you will tell me your final decision."</p>

<p>He then winks at Lingyu.</p>

<p>Lingyu blinks as well, and she nods her head.</p>

<p>Lingyun grabs the sandbag and puts it upon his shoulders, drawing a long curve in the air.</p>

<p>In seeing Lingyun's agility in that movement, Ma's determination to have Lingyun enter the world of professional sports grows even more.</p>

<p>"Where should I leave the bag?" Lingyun asks Ma.</p>

<p>"The students will bring it back to the gym once the lessons are over" Ma replies.</p>

<p>Lingyun then lets the bag fall to the ground.</p>

<p>"Thank you teacher Ma, we'll be going now!"</p>

<p>At the opposite corner of the playground, there is someone else looking absent mindedly at the two students.</p>

<p>"Ning Lingyu looks really happy today. How beautiful she is ..."</p>

<p>"Surely it is because Lingyun won ten thousand yuan?!"</p>

<p>"Look at Lingyun, look at that fatty laughing!"</p>

<p>Tang Meng is experiencing a lot of different emotions all at once; concern, anger, remorse...</p>

<p>He suddenly turns towards Li Lei, and asks him: "How much money did we make with today's bet?"</p>

<p>"We received 9,500 in total, but it's really only 3,500, because we have to give 6,000 to Cao Shanshan and Xie Junyan."</p>

<p>"9500, and I still owe 10,500 to Ning Lingyu. I lost a thousand yuan! Damn it!"</p>

<p>He never lost until today!</p>

<p>As soon as he stops complaining, Tang Meng breaks into laughter.</p>

<p><a name="result_box1"></a>"Boss, why are you laughing now?" Li Lei thinks Tang Meng has gone insane.</p>

<p>"When you lose, you also receive something! Learn that!"</p>

<p>"Don't you understand! You see, when I'll give all that money to Lingyu, don't you think she will be happy? And if she feels happy, won't she look at me in a different way?"</p>

<p>"Let's go withdraw the money from the band, it's only ten thousand yuan, I don't even care..."</p>

<p>"Do we have to climb over the gate again?" Li Lei whispers to Tang Meng.</p>

<p>"Let's hurry. Lingyu will be so happy, that she will surely ask me out on launch!"</p>

<p>The light behind Tang Meng's eyes turns cruel, and he spits on the ground.</p>

<p>"On the way back, tell Xie Junyan that if he dares to do anything behind my back ever again, I will need to have a word with him!"</p>

<p>"Brother, I think teacher Ma's proposal is really good. I heard that he graduated at the University of Yanterritory, he will definitely manage to have you accepted there. Then I will enroll in the same University, and we will be staying in the same city!"</p>

<p>Once they get closer to the dorm, Lingyu is repeating that to Lingyun one more time.</p>

<p>"Is the University of Yanjing really the best one?" Lingyun asks.</p>

<p>"Sure!" She is certain to be admitted at the University of Yanjing, so she is speaking with a hint of pride.</p>

<p>"So be it, I will enroll in that University as well!" Lingyun takes that decision in his mind.</p>

<p>If he has to go to the University, he has to get into the best one; that's Lingyun's opinion.</p>

<p>Saying it in his own words, going to a worse place would not be his style!</p>

<p>"Brother..." Lingyu seems concerned "Didn't the race exhaust you too much?"</p>

<p>She is the best student of the whole school, so being admitted at the University of Yanjing will not be an issue for her. But her brother is the worst of all the students, there is no way he will make it by just studying like crazy from that moment on, with only two months left.</p>

<p>"I've not gone crazy, don't you worry. At due time, I'll prove it to you." Lingyun says smiling.</p>

<p>Although right now he lacks the energy, his soul is that of a farmer, and in the past he achieved things far greater than passing a state exam! Thanks to his memory, he will certainly learn all the necessary subjects. His growing prospects are even greater than those of many other farmers!</p>

<p>"Go get yourself ready, we'll meet here in half an hour, I'll take you have something really good to eat!" Lingyun says lovingly.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Lingyu replies filled with joy.</p>
